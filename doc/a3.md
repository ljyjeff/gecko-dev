Diagnosis of your bug: Move several related React components into a sub-directory. This makes the codebase easier to navigate, allowing devs to not have to look throught a big list of RequestList components when they're looking for something else. The risk of fixing this bug is not properly updating all references to these components.

Propose a  solution: All 'RequestList' prefixed files should be moved into a new sub-directory named request-list. Relative path references in these files will need to be updated to go one directory above. Uses of these files (requires) will need to be updated to '/request-list/...'. The uses will be found by using https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/ to search for references.

Testing document - The request list is within the netmonitor component in the inspector. Manual test to make sure the request list shows up will be done while developing. Automated tests will be ran to make sure nothing was missed.

P.S. I submitted a patch arc before I read that it was to be done afterwards: https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D52981
